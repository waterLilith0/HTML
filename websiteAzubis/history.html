              <p>
                In addition to writing fiction, Tolkien was an author of academic literary criticism.<br/>
                His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment<br/>
                of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf by literary critics. The essay remains highly<br/>
                influential in the study of Old English literature to this day. Beowulf is one of<br/>
                the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of<br/>
                both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings being adapted from the poem.

                This essay discusses the fairy-story as a literary form. It was initially written<br/>
                as the 1939 Andrew Lang Lecture at the University of St Andrews, Scotland. Tolkien<br/>
                focuses on Andrew Lang's work as a folklorist and collector of fairy tales.<br/>
                He disagreed with Lang's broad inclusion, in his Fairy Book collections, of<br/>
                traveller's tales, beast fables, and other types of stories. Tolkien held a<br/>
                narrower perspective, viewing fairy stories as those that took place in Faerie,<br/>
                an enchanted realm, with or without fairies as characters. He viewed them as the<br/>
                natural development of the interaction of human imagination and human language.
