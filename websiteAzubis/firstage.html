        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
          Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, smokes in his porch-way at Bag End one day, when Gandalf the wizard visits him. <br/>
          After a lengthy discussion in which Bilbo says "good morning" several times, Bilbo becomes flustered.<br/>
          He invites Gandalf to tea, and goes back inside his Hobbit-hole with a final "good morning".<br/>
          Gandalf stays outside, and before leaving, carves a secret mark on Bilbo's front door that indiciates:<br/>
          "Burglar wants a good job, plenty of excitement and reasonable reward." Soon afterward, thirteen<br/>
          Dwarves (Thorin II Oakenshield, Glóin, Óin, Ori, Nori, Dori, Dwalin, Balin, Fíli and Kíli, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur)<br/>
          arrive at Bag End and begin discussing their planned treasure hunt while the hapless Bilbo provides obligatory<br/>
          hospitality. After the Dwarves and Bilbo clean up the mess of their hefty supper, a map is produced and Gandalf<br/>
          arranges for Bilbo to take the job of burglar. The company's quest is to use a secret door to enter the Lonely Mountain,<br/>
          send forth their burglar to steal as much of the riches within its halls as possible, and do reconnaissance,<br/>
          then, to slay the dragon Smaug who had claimed the Mountains, and become rich again.<br/><br/>
          The next morning, after oversleeping and nearly missing the start of the journey, Bilbo goes off with the Dwarves. <br/>
          They are nearly eaten by 3 trolls, Tom, Bert, and William, but Gandalf manages to deceive the trolls into staying up <br/>
          all night whereupon they are turned into stone by the first light of dawn and die (the stone trolls appear later in <br/>
          The Fellowship of the Ring). In the Trolls' lair they find the trolls' storage of supplies, including several weapons.<br/> 
          Bilbo acquires an Elvish short sword which he will later name Sting, which glows blue in the presence of Orcs. <br/>
          Thorin acquires Orcrist, and Gandalf acquires Glamdring.<br/><br/>
          The party travels to Rivendell, where they enjoy the hospitality of Elves. There, Elrond finds Moon-letters <br/>
          on the company's map of the mountain, giving information about a secret door on its side. They then<br/>
          eastward toward the Misty Mountains. There they are captured by goblins, and carried to Goblin-town.<br/>
          They run away, and during the escape Bilbo loses the Dwarves. Alone in the dark after running away from<br/>
          the goblins, Bilbo finds a gold ring on the floor of a cave passage and puts it in his pocket. Little did he<br/>
          know that this was the One Ring lost by Sauron centuries ago.<br/><br/>
          Continuing down a tunnel, he finds himself at the shore of an underground lake. Gollum quietly paddles up in his boat,<br/>
          and the two enact the riddle-game, under the condition that if Bilbo wins, Gollum will show him the way out, but if <br/>
          Bilbo loses, Gollum will eat him. After several riddles, which each manages to answer, Bilbo, whilst fiddling in his pocket<br/>
          unable to think of a riddle, asks himself aloud "What have I got in my pocket?". Gollum thinks this is supposed to be the <br/>
          next riddle, and as it doesn't comply with the rules of the riddle-game, demands three guesses; in the end he fails to guess<br/>
          the answer. Bilbo demands his reward, but Gollum refuses and paddles off in his boat to an island in the lake, upon which he lives.<br/>
          After searching around for a while asking aloud "Where is it? Where's my precious!?" to which Bilbo replies, "I don't know and I don't care.<br/>
          I just want to get out of here", Gollum becomes suspicious, gets in his boat, and starts paddling back across the lake towards Bilbo.<br/>
          Bilbo realizes his life is in danger and makes his escape down the maze of pitch-black tunnels, and Gollum gives chase. Bilbo trips, and finds<br/>
          the ring on his finger.  Realizing he has no chance to escape his pursuer, he stays where he is and prepares to meet his fate, but Gollum runs<br/>
          right over him. Bilbo realizes the Ring, while on his finger, makes him invisible. He manages to escape past Gollum,<br/>
          who has gone to guard the only exit, and finds his way to the surface where he rejoins the Dwarves.<br/><br/>
          Descending from the Misty Mountains, they survive an encounter with Wargs (large evil wolves) and goblins by climbing trees.<br/>
          Eagles, summoned by Gandalf, then came to rescue them.  They soon meet Beorn, a man who can transform into a bear.<br/>
          They depart, having rested for several days. Gandalf leaves soon on an errand. The party traverses the great forest, Mirkwood,<br/>
          eventually running out of supplies. Gandalf had warned them not to leave the Elf-path, but they saw fire and heard singing, so,<br/>
          hopeless, they leave the path to beg food from Wood-elves, only to get lost. They are captured by giant spiders, but Bilbo rescues the<br/>
          Dwarves by becoming invisible via the Ring and killing many spiders with Sting and rocks. Elves then capture the Dwarves and imprison them,<br/>
          but Bilbo manages to sneak into the Elvenking Thranduil's palace unnoticed using the Ring; he then helps the Dwarves escape in barrels floating down the river.<br/><br/>
          After staying for a short period of time at Lake-town, the treasure-seekers proceed to the Lonely Mountain. Finding themselves unable to locate the secret door,<br/>
          the company sits down, depressed, on a cliff. Hearing a Thrush knocking on a stone, Bilbo looks up just in time to see the last rays of the<br/>
          Sun of Durin's Day, shining on the cliff wall, to magically reveal the secret door (as was foretold by moon-letters upon a map that the company<br/>
          was in possession of). Bilbo is sent down to meet Smaug, the dragon, who realized the Company received help from the people of Lake-town, and<br/>
          sets out to destroy it. However, the Thrush that had been knocking on the stone was no ordinary bird but of an ancient race with whom<br/>
          the Men of Dale could communicate, and it had heard Bilbo's report to the Dwarves; that Smaug had a bare patch in his armor on the left side<br/>
          of his chest (nearest his heart) that could be used to slaughter him, if only you could get close enough. It conveyed this message to<br/>
          one Bard the Bowman, who seeing the bare patch on the chest of Smaug, dispatched the dragon with a single black arrow, thus<br/>
          allowing the party of Dwarves to take possession of the treasure.<br/><br/>
          The citizens of Lake-town arrive to make historical claims and demand compensation for the help they had rendered,<br/>
          as well as reparations for damage Smaug inflicted during his attack. They're joined by the Elves, who also demand a<br/>
          share based on historical claims. The Dwarves refuse all negotiations and in turn summon kin from the mountains to<br/>
          strengthen their position. Seeing no other way to avert a war, Bilbo uses the Ring to steal the prized Arkenstone of<br/>
          Thráin from the Dwarves, which he uses to broker peace. However, after revealing this to Thorin, the latter becomes furious<br/>
          and kicks him out. Bilbo then leaves and joins the recently returned Gandalf and Lake-Town citizens.<br/><br/>
          Just as a grudging truce is agreed to, the three armies at the Lonely Mountain (Elves, Men, and Dwarves) are<br/>
          attacked by Goblins and Wargs from the Misty Mountains. A bitter battle ensues (named the Battle of Five Armies).<br/>
          Though suffering heavy losses, Elves, Men, and Dwarves prevail with the help of the Eagles. Thorin, Fili and Kili<br/>
          are unfortunately killed in the battle, but just before he dies, Thorin makes peace with Bilbo. The treasure is apportioned.<br/>
          Bilbo refuses most of the riches, realizing he has no way to bring them back home; he nevertheless takes enough with him<br/>
          to make himself a wealthy hobbit and live happily thereafter, unaware of the dangerous nature of his Ring, which he<br/>
          places in a glass case on his mantle. Gandalf and Balin later visit Bilbo at Bag-End.<br/><br/>
