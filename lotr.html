        <h1>The Lord of the Rings</h1>
        <h2>The book</h2>
        <p>
          The title refers to the story's main antagonist,[b] Sauron, the Dark Lord who 
          in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power given to 
          Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in his campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From 
          homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English 
          countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to 
          destroy the One Ring, seen mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, 
          Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Aiding Frodo are the Wizard Gandalf, the Men Aragorn 
          and Boromir, the Elf Legolas, and the Dwarf Gimli, who unite in order to 
          rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth against Sauron's armies and give 
          Frodo a chance to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom.
